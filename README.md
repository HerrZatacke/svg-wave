# grb2nc.js (TypeScript based Gerber to gCode transformer)

grb2nc is a simple open-source online Gerber to gCode transformer. If you need to create gCode for your PCB prototypes, this tool can help you.

## Inspiration
Seeing [Mathias Wandel's YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlvHNgOD__Y) on his [Python based approach](https://github.com/Matthias-Wandel/Gerber2nc) and having struggled with various programs too, gave me the idea to build a web-based tool for generating simple gCode.  
I wanted to make the configuration more accessible to non-developers though.  

## Features
The app allows setting various parameters for your milling/engraving operations:

Each layer can run with separate offset and number of steps
